# Salesforce Revenue Cloud & MuleSoft Architect Showcase

**Author:** Mustafa Aksu  
**Project Type:** Professional Portfolio & Enterprise Delivery Simulation  
**Primary Focus:** End-to-End Revenue Cloud + MuleSoft Integration Architecture  
**Target Roles:** Revenue Cloud Architect | MuleSoft Integration Developer | Solution Consultant

## Why This Project Exists

This project exists to simulate a **real-world enterprise delivery** using Salesforce Revenue Cloud and MuleSoft.

Unlike typical code demos, this repository proves:
- Deep architecture understanding
- Advanced Salesforce + MuleSoft integration capabilities
- Apex, Flow, and API expertise
- CI/CD & automation mindset
- Clean, structured, presentation-ready delivery

> **If you're a hiring manager or architect, this is not a tutorial.**  
> **This is a proof of real, hands-on capability to lead technical delivery.**

## Use Case 1: IoT Usage-Based Billing + Dynamic Proration + Revenue Recognition

### Scenario:
A smart device (e.g. energy meter) sends daily usage data to MuleSoft.

### Integration Flow:

1. **Device sends data** â†’ API Gateway
2. **MuleSoft Flow**
   - Validates payload
   - Logs payload
   - Triggers Salesforce API with usage + product ID

3. **Salesforce**
   - Uses Flow to fetch Billing Contract
   - Apex Class calculates prorated billing (code below)
   - Creates a custom Revenue Schedule record

### Code Snippet: Proration Logic (Apex)

```apex
public class UsageBillingService {
    public static Decimal calculateProration(Date startDate, Date endDate, Decimal baseAmount) {
        Integer daysInPeriod = startDate.daysBetween(endDate);
        Decimal dailyRate = baseAmount / 30;
        return dailyRate * daysInPeriod;
    }
}
Metadata + Flow Connection
	â€¢	Custom Metadata: Revenue Rule Matrix (Product Type vs Forecast Template)
	â€¢	Flow: Record-Triggered Flow â†’ Launch Apex â†’ Create Revenue_Schedule__c

Use Case 2: SAP CAMT.054 Payment Integration

Scenario:

SAP sends CAMT.054 payment return messages to MuleSoft after customer payments.

Integration Flow:
	1.	SAP â†’ Sends camt.054 XML via HTTPS POST
	2.	MuleSoft
	â€¢	Parses XML â†’ JSON
	â€¢	Logs entry + errors
	â€¢	Matches Invoice â†’ pushes Payment to Salesforce
	3.	Salesforce
	â€¢	Matches against Invoice Number
	â€¢	Updates Billing Status
	â€¢	Triggers Revenue Adjustment if underpaid/overpaid

Sample MuleSoft Mapping Logic (Pseudocode)

<OriginalGrpInf>
  <OrgnlMsgId>ABC123456789</OrgnlMsgId>
  <TxInf>
    <OrgnlInstrId>INV-1000123</OrgnlInstrId>
    <Amt>350.00</Amt>
  </TxInf>
</OriginalGrpInf>

â€¢	MuleSoft extracts OrgnlInstrId â†’ Finds matching Invoice in Salesforce
	â€¢	Posts /services/data/vXX.X/sobjects/Payment__c/ with structured body

Use Case 3: Mid-Term Subscription Upgrade + Revenue Schedule Reforecast

Scenario:

Customer upgrades their plan (e.g., from Silver to Gold) mid-term.

Actions:
	1.	Salesforce Flow:
	â€¢	Detects Product Change on Amendment Quote
	2.	Apex Trigger:
	â€¢	Calculates revenue difference between old and new plan
	â€¢	Updates or regenerates Revenue_Schedule__c records
	3.	Jenkins Trigger:
	â€¢	Push to upgrade-feature-branch runs test classes
	â€¢	If passed, GitHub PR auto-deploys to UAT

Apex Class: Revenue Reforecasting

public class RevenueRealignment {
    public static void reforecast(Id subscriptionId) {
        List<Revenue_Schedule__c> schedules = [SELECT Id, Amount__c FROM Revenue_Schedule__c WHERE Subscription__c = :subscriptionId];
        for (Revenue_Schedule__c rs : schedules) {
            rs.Amount__c = rs.Amount__c * 1.2; // Example: 20% upgrade
        }
        update schedules;
    }
}

Final Thoughts

This project was built from scratch to simulate real-world architecture challenges.

No templates.
No pre-baked sandboxes.
Every integration, test, and diagram â€” designed to showcase what a Revenue Cloud Architect really does.
